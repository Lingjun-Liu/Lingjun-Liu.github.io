# Knowledge Map Overview

This map serves as the table of contents for my research, teaching, and learning artefacts. Each node links to detailed notes or project folders within this repository.

## 1. Research Directions

| Theme | Guiding Questions | Representative Artefacts |
|-------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| **Platform Governance & Fertility** | How do platform algorithms influence family planning discourse and behaviors? | Policy brief notes · Weibo/Reddit text corpora · Fertility sentiment dashboards |
| **Gender, Technology & Care** | Which socio-technical systems reproduce or mitigate gendered labor? | Fieldwork memos · Platform ethnography notes · Care economy datasets |
| **Aging, Ageism & Digital Health** | In what ways do digital services amplify or reduce age-based inequalities? | Age-friendly design audits · Health app log analyses · Interview summaries |
| **Urban Demography & Migration** | What narratives emerge from mobility data and urban policy documents? | Mobility trajectory studies · City-level data books · Comparative case syntheses |

## 2. Method Toolbox

### 2.1 Text Analytics
- Corpus building workflow and cleaning scripts
- Topic modeling comparisons (LDA, STM, BERTopic)
- Transformer-based classifiers with human-in-the-loop annotation

### 2.2 Causal Inference & Decomposition
- Difference-in-differences notebooks with staggered adoption diagnostics
- Synthetic control templates for policy evaluation
- RIF-OB decomposition walkthroughs for wage and health inequality studies
- Mediation analysis cheat sheets linking counterfactual and graphical approaches

### 2.3 Temporal & State Models
- Multi-state Markov model case studies for health trajectories
- PVAR applications to platform activity and demographic indicators
- Trajectory clustering tutorials with visualization recipes

### 2.4 Interpretability & Diagnostics
- SHAP explainability guides for tree-based and deep models
- Sensitivity analyses catalogued by method (e.g., Rosenbaum bounds, placebo tests)
- Reproducibility checklist for each modeling pipeline

## 3. Knowledge Assets

- **Reading Notebooks.** Structured summaries of books and articles with key quotes, critiques, and follow-up questions.
- **Data Books.** Documentation of datasets including provenance, cleaning choices, and variable dictionaries.
- **Project Logbooks.** Chronological entries capturing modeling decisions, failures, and pivots.
- **Teaching Materials.** Slides, hands-on labs, and exercises from workshops or guest lectures.

Each asset includes:
1. Front-matter metadata (date, tags, collaborators).
2. Cross-links to related methods or research questions.
3. “Next iteration” tasks to keep the knowledge network evolving.

## 4. Navigation & Maintenance

1. Start with [`notes/index.md`](./notes) for a chronological feed of updates.
2. Use tags such as `#text-mining`, `#causal-inference`, or `#platform-studies` to jump between related materials.
3. Check the changelog section in each folder (`notes/CHANGELOG.md`, etc.) to see how ideas compound over time.
4. When a theme graduates into a standalone project (e.g., a full pipeline or publication), it moves to its own repository and is referenced here.
