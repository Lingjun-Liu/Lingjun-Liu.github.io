## 🧭 Welcome

This site is my **knowledge structure in progress** — a place where I organize and share notes, talks, and reflections from my research and learning.

Rather than a CV, this page documents how my ideas evolve:  
from computational sociology methods, to theories of platform mechanisms, gender, and digital life.

> “I treat GitHub as a public notebook — a transparent record of how I learn, connect, and create.”
