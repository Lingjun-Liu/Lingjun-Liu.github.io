## 🧭 Welcome

This site is my **knowledge structure in progress** — a place where I organize and share notes, talks, and reflections from my research and learning.

Rather than a CV, this page documents how my ideas evolve: from computational sociology methods, to theories of platform mechanisms, gender, and digital life.

> “I treat GitHub as a public notebook — a transparent record of how I learn, connect, and create.”

## 👋 About Me

- 🎓 **Academic focus.** Demography Ph.D. candidate researching how platform technologies reshape family, health, and gender outcomes.
- 🧪 **Method strengths.** Mixed-methods approach combining computational text analysis, causal inference, and demographic modeling.
- 🤝 **Current collaborations.** Building cross-disciplinary projects with data scientists, public health scholars, and civic organizations to translate research into impact.
- 🧠 **Learning right now.** Deep dives into multi-state Markov models, causal mediation, and responsible AI frameworks.

## 🧩 Knowledge Map

A living outline of the themes I work on. Explore the full structure in the [Knowledge Map overview](./knowledge-map.md).

- **Research Directions**
  - Platform governance & reproductive behavior
  - Gender, technology, and care infrastructure
  - Aging, ageism, and digital health equity
  - Urban demography and migration stories
- **Method Toolbox**
  - Text analytics: topic models, transformer-based embeddings, human-in-the-loop coding
  - Causal inference: DID, synthetic control, causal forests, RIF-OB decomposition
  - Temporal & state models: PVAR, multi-state Markov, trajectory clustering
  - Interpretability & diagnostics: SHAP analysis, sensitivity checks, robustness pipelines
- **Knowledge Assets**
  - Reading summaries of books, datasets, and seminal papers
  - Project logbooks documenting modeling decisions and reflections
  - Teaching & workshop materials for classes and invited talks
